# An R parser for ArchieML

This package is a wrapper for [archieml-js](https://github.com/newsdev/archieml-js),
a parser for the New York Times' [ArchieML](http://archieml.org/) format.  ArchieML is designed
to include structured data in free-form documents.

Right now it just has one function, `from_archie`, which loads ArchieML data from a string, file, or URL.

archieml-js (included under `inst`, using `git subtree`) parses ArchieML to JSON.  It is run using V8, and then the JSON data is imported via jsonlite.


## Install

Note that, because it uses the V8 package, rchie has a system requirement of libv8.

```
library(devtools)
install_github('ropensci/rchie')
```

## Usage

`from_archie` can read ArchieML from a string, file, or URL:

```{r}
library(rchie)
data1 = "
  [arrayName]
  
  Jeremy spoke with her on Friday, follow-up scheduled for next week
  name: Amanda
  age: 26
  
  # Contact: 434-555-1234
  name: Tessa
  age: 30
  
  []
  "

from_archie(data1)          
from_archie('http://archieml.org/test/1.0/arrays.1.aml')
```

Note that you can pass arguments through `from_archie` to `jsonlite::fromJSON` to
determine how JSON is converted to R objects:

```{r}
from_archie(data1, simplifyVector=FALSE)
```

See http://archieml.org/ for more examples of ArchieML
