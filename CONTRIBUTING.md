Contributing to the rchie R package
===================================

You want to contribute to **rchie**? Great!

Please submit questions, bug reports, and requests in the [issues
tracker](https://github.com/ecohealthalliance/fasterize/issues). Please submit
bug reports with a minimal [reprex](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/#reprex).

Note that this package wraps
[archieml-js](https://github.com/newsdev/archieml-js), by the New York Times so
many actual parser errors are best reported there. Suggestions to change the
ArchieML [spec](http://archieml.org/spec/1.0/CR-20151015.html) should be
discussed under the issues at <https://github.com/newsdev/archieml.org>.

If you plan to contribute code, go ahead and fork the repo and submit a pull
request. A few notes:

-   This package is released with a [Contributor Code of
    Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating in this project you agree to
    abide by its terms. Why? We want contribution to be enjoyable and rewarding
    for everyone!
-   If you have large change, please open an issue first to discuss.
-   I'll generally include contributors as authors in the DESCRIPTION file (with
    their permission) for most contributions that go beyond small typos in code
    or documentation.
-   This package generally uses the [rOpenSci packaging
    guidelines](https://ropensci.github.io/dev_guide/) for style and structure.
-   Documentation is generated by **roxygen2**. Please write documentation in
    code files and let it auto-generate documentation files. We use a recent
    version so documentation my be [written in
    markdown](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/vignettes/markdown.html)
-   We aim for testing that has high coverage and is robust. Include tests with
    any major contribution to code. Test your changes the package with
    [**goodpractice**](https://github.com/MangoTheCat/goodpractice) before
    submitting your change.
-  I'm avoiding too many dependencies.  If there's some fancy extension you'd
   like to add make it optional using `if(requireNamepace(...))` statements and
   placing the dependency in `Suggests:`, as is currently done for the Google
   Drive functionality.

Roadmap
-------

I don't have big plans to expand **rchie**, but here are some things that might
happen at some point if someone is inclined to tackle them.

-   I'd love to have some more examples.  If you have a project that uses
    **rchie** that you'd like to share, please let me know!  I'll link to it
    or perhaps make a vignette.
-   It might be fun to build a pure R or C++ parser and not require V8 or any
    system requirements.
-   It would be useful to parse value fields in Google Docs so as to get links
    (as this archieml-js
    [example](https://github.com/newsdev/archieml-js/blob/master/examples/google_drive.js)),
    or even translate other formatting to markdown. This would require
    downloading the Google Doc as HTML, parsing and converting it.
-   Since the package already contains the Javascript of archieml-js, it might
    be neat to create an htmlwidget that injects this into the page of an R
    Markdown or Shiny app, and makes the data from a Google Doc or other source
    available so the page live-updates.
